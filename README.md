# üöó Smart Parking Detection

Smart Parking Detection is a hackathon project that uses **FastAPI**, **Google Gemini AI**, **Streamlit**, and **OpenCV** to analyze live drone/stream video feeds and predict parking occupancy trends in real time.

The system captures frames from a livestream or fallback video, ingests them through Gemini AI for parking spot detection, stores results in a JSON history, and then forecasts future parking demand using a Random Forest model. A Streamlit dashboard visualizes live occupancy, historical trends, and AI-powered forecasts.
